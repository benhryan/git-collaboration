1. These are both fast forward merges. Explain?
   
Both merges in the image are fast-forward merges because develop had no new commits after neat_branch and messy_branch were created. Instead of creating merge commits, Git simply moves develop forward to the latest commit of each branch, keeping the history linear and clean.

2. In your own words, write down a scenario that will involve a merge conflict between develop and conflict_branch. Add your answer to readme.doc

A merge conflict will happen if both develop and conflict_branch change the same line in a file differently. If develop changes line 15 in README.md to "first change of conflict section!" while conflict_branch changes it to "second change of the conflict", Git won’t know which to keep and will ask for a manual fix during the merge. We can then accept the second change to choose.

3. In your own words, write down a scenario that will NOT involve a merge conflict between develop and conflict_branch despite some change on the same file on both branches
   
A merge conflict will not occur if changes on develop and conflict_branch are made to different parts of the same file. For example, if develop adds a paragraph at the end of a file while conflict_branch modifies the title, Git can merge them automatically. Since the changes do not overlap, Git can integrate both without any issues.
